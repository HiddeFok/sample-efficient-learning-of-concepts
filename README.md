# Sample-efficient Learning of Conecpts with Theoretical Guarantees: The Code for the Experiments

This repository contains all the relevant code to run the experiments that are conducted in the paper 'Sample-efficient Learning of Concepts with Theoretical Guarantees:
from Data to Concepts without Interventions'

## Structure of the repository

This repository is divided into 3 sub directories. 

* `permutation_estimator`: Contains our implementations
of the two estimators that we propose in the form of two Scikit-Learn inspired classes
* `idea_experiments`: Contains all the code to run the Toy Dataset experiments
* `DL_experiments`: Contains all the code to run the VAE experiments
